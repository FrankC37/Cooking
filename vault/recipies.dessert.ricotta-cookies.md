5.  Mix in ricotta gently (think folding egg whites in)

6. Rest 5 mins then use small cookie scoop onto parchment lines baking sheets

7. Bake @ 350 for 12-15 mins (14:40 in my oven), they should not be browned on top, just gently browned on the bottom.

8. Remove and place on wire rack to cool, once cooled they are good to frost.

### Frosting

- 170 Grams of Powered Sugar
- 1 tsp lemon juice
- 2 tbsp water

1. Mix all of these together until you get a god consistency
    - Frosting should be runny but still have some thickness to it, you will likely have to make multiple batches of this as youll use alot when frosting

2. After frosted let sit on rack until firm, them move to baking trays for a few hours to firm up, store in air tight container
