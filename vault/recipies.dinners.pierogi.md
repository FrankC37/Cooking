# Piergoi

## PIEROGI DOUGH (see alternate doughs below)

### Ingredients

- 360 grams all-purpose flour

- 110 g milk (or water)

- 2 eggs

- 7 g salt

- 10 g oil (optional)


## Technique

### Mixing Dough

- Mix the eggs and milk (or water). Beat until combined.

- Place a large bowl over a scale and add the flour. Pour the liquid mixture into the flour along with the salt and oil. Mix until a shaggy dough forms. Let rest for 10 minutes.

- Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter. Knead the dough for 8-10 minutes until smooth and it passes a gluten window test. Cover and store in the fridge until ready to use, probably max like 1 day.

### Filling & Forming

- Roll the dough out quite thin. Using a bowl, cut out circles in the dough. With the dough scraps, form into a bowl and roll out again until all the dough is used up.

- Set a pot of water to a boil. Add a large pinch of salt and stir to dissolve.

- Meanwhile, add a spoonful of the potato filling to each of the circles. Lightly flatten the potato filling to roughly half of the circle. Fold the dough over and crimp the edges of the dough to seal it. Optionally, you can use a fork to crimp the edges. Repeat the process for the remaining pierogies.

### Cooking, Storing, & Serving

- When the water has boiled, drop a couple of pierogis in. Lightly stir once and then let the pierogis cook. Once they start to float to the top, set a timer, and cook for 2 minutes. Drain with a slotted spoon and set aside in a container. Cook remaining pierogis

```Note: The pierogis can be frozen or stored in the fridge until ready to serve```

- To serve, set a cast iron over medium heat. Add some butter and thinly sliced onions. Let cook while stirring occasionally until lightly browned about 10 minutes. Add in the pierogis and fry until lightly browned and crisp. Serve with sour cream and chives


### Making the Fillings

#### POTATO FILLING

**Ingredients:**

- 1000 g (2 lbs) Russet or Yukon gold potatoes

- Salt

- Sharp cheddar cheese, grated

- 1 tbsp butter (optional)

- Chives (optional)

#### Method

- Peel and cube the potatoes. Set a pot of water on medium-high heat and add a large pinch of salt. Add the potatoes and stir a couple of times to dissolve the salt. Bring to a boil until the potatoes are fork-tender.

- Drain the potatoes in a colander. Spread on a cutting board and mash with a fork. Sprinkle over the cheddar cheese and chop up a tbsp of butter. Mix until combined being careful not to over mix. The potatoes should be pretty dry.

- Store in a container in the fridge until ready to form.
